# FastAPI S3 Application

## Overview
The FastAPI S3 Application is a web service built using FastAPI that allows users to manage file operations with AWS S3. It provides endpoints for uploading files, listing files, and retrieving file content from an S3 bucket. This application is designed to be robust, secure, and easy to use, leveraging the power of FastAPI for asynchronous operations and Boto3 for interacting with AWS S3.

## Features
- **Upload Files**: Upload files to a specified S3 bucket.
- **List Files**: Retrieve a list of all files stored in the S3 bucket.
- **Get File Content**: Download the content of a specified file from the S3 bucket.

## Technical Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **FastAPI**
- **Uvicorn**
- **Boto3**
- **AWS Account with S3 Access**

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **AWS Account**: An AWS account with access to S3 is required.
3. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI with your credentials.
4. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-s3-app.git
   cd fastapi-s3-app
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure your AWS credentials are configured in your environment using:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8005 --reload
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Upload a File
Use the following `curl` command to upload a file:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/upload/" -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.jpg"
```

### List Files
To list all files in the S3 bucket, use:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8005/files/"
```

### Get File Content
To retrieve the content of a specific file, use:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8005/files/your_file_name.jpg" -o output.jpg
```

## Notes
- Ensure your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket `bucket-for-ai-generated-content`.
- The application should be run in a secure environment, and it is recommended to use HTTPS for production deployments.
- Consider implementing additional security measures such as rate limiting and authentication for production use.
